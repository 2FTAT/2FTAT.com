Adam’s daughter thinks he sleeps at his office.

On paper, he’s got it made: multiple degrees from prestigious schools, an enviable career, and a comfortable salary. He’s got a wife, two daughters, a nice house in a good neighborhood — this dude’s life seems pretty charmed.

But Adam’s not happy. Long hours and no work-life balance — Adam calls it more of a “work-_work_ balance” — have left him feeling stuck, and contemplating quitting it all in search of something more meaningful.

In this conversation, Nate Green and Jason Lengstorf talk with Adam about what balance, perception, and success really mean. Then the three of them come up with an experiment that just might change Adam’s life — _without_ requiring him to ruin his career.
