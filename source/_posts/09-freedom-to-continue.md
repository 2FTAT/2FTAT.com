When the shit hits the fan and your back’s against the wall and you’ve run out of other dramatic cliches, what habits, mindsets, and material things do you need to have in your life to continue on your path and be successful?

That’s what this episode is all about.

Although we go on our normal huge philosophical rants, this episode of 2FTAT is extremely tactical.

We talk about:

- how much money is enough, and how much debt is acceptable
- investing in yourself by building skills and networking
- defining your own version of a “successful life”
- getting rid of unnecessary things (both physical and mental)
- and a lot more
