According [to Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/why), **you should be optimizing your life for one thing — but that one thing is a different thing for each person.**

In this conversation, Nate and Jason discuss what they’re currently optimizing for, what they’ve optimized for in the past, and how those decisions have evolved over time.

Additional topics (tangents?) include:

- giving yourself the freedom to continue
- avoiding mediocrity
- the unexpected side benefits of optimizing our lives
