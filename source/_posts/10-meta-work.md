Nate and Jason are back in Portland, which means we no longer have excuses not to record new episodes! ðŸ˜…

How do people make choices? What mental models, frameworks, and other factors go into making those choices. And more importantly, _where the hell do those mental models come from_?

In this episode, Nate and Jason talk about how they built their own decision-making frameworks by borrowing ideas from business, doing concentrated exercises to help them identify what theyâ€™re especially good at, and doing the [meta-work](https://lengstorf.com/yak-shaving) to decide what they really care about in the first place.
