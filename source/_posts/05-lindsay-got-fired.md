Lindsay always thought she'd eventually know what she wanted to be when she grew up.

But after changing majors, grad school, getting married, and working in a job for three and a half years, she's still not quite sure what "grown up" means, or what she wants to be — and the fact that she just got laid off is making that question a little more pressing.

In this conversation, Nate Green and Jason Lengstorf talk with Lindsay about building skills instead of putting in time at a job, creating routines to keep us on track, and whether or not knowing what we want to be when we grow up is actually a good thing. At the end, the three of them devise an experiment for Lindsay to try that will help her keep the good stuff going, even when she starts a new job.

4:40 — "I found the unmute button." – Jason

6:41 — "The only way you could ever know exactly what you want would be to stop evolving." - Jason

8:46 — "With careers it always seems so dire. ... Our interests don't align with our careers." – Lindsay

13:58 — "The people who seem to be happiest ... is it because of an overlap of those skills and interests?" – Jason

24:13 — "As long as it's in service of a skill that seems really interesting to you ... that's a really, really good place to start." – Nate

54:26 — "How can you create a similar type of ritual that will allow you to do that stuff, and would you be willing to let us follow along?" – Jason

56:55 — "Do you feel that you have a certain couple of skills that you're going to try to use in this role ... something that is really interesting to you that you're looking to get better at?" – Nate
