Tony is just about ready to close his business and start working at Starbucks.

After ten years in the fitness industry, he feels like he's lost the spark, and he's not sure what he should do next — he just knows that what he's doing right now isn't making him happy.

In this conversation, Nate Green and Jason Lengstorf talk with Tony about what we can do to find direction without having to burn it all down and start over. How can you tell if it's time to make a major change? If something feels wrong, what would make it feel right? We cover all this, and in the end come up with a surprising experiment for Tony that just might set him back on the track to happiness.

**NOTE:** The audio on this call is a little janky, with some background noise and lag, since everyone was calling in from different corners of the world. If you can forgive the quality of the recording, we hope the quality of the content makes up for it.
