<p>3:45 — The guys start to break down the keys to their post-high school success.</p>
<p>8:30 — “I was working in the most soul-sucking job I’ve ever had, which was as tech support for a major satellite TV company. And that — oh my god — that is like looking into the maw of hell.” – Jason</p>
<p>10:19 — “Having you come and basically look around and go ‘Dude, are you serious about this?’ — that was a good wake-up call and it was definitely something that was very helpful in pulling my shit back on track.” – Jason</p>
<p>12:28 — “I took a lot of risks that other people saw as risks that I didn’t.” – Nate</p>
<p>13:23 — “I was just ambitious and just annoying enough to get on their radar but not enough to piss them off to where they didn’t wanna talk to me anymore, and those became my first couple of mentors.” </p>
<p>13:50 —  Nate’s quick story about turning down cute girls, rejecting Alwyn Cosgrove’s advice, running sprints, and vomiting in a 12-hour span.</p>

<p>37:09 — “The idea is success is fluid so I think it’s just a matter of defining it for yourself and then, I don’t know, being ok with whatever happens after.” – Nate</p>
<p>38:50 — “The goal of a project isn’t to launch the project. The goal of a project is to enjoy working on the project.” – Jason</p>
<p>40:09 — “The most successful person in the world is still looking toward their next thing.” – Jason</p>
<p>40:40 — “I found out that we’re technically millennials, which at first kinda made me sad, but now I don’t care.” – Jason</p>
