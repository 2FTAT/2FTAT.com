        <p>Adam’s daughter thinks he sleeps at his office.</p>
<p>On paper, he’s got it made: multiple degrees from prestigious schools, an enviable career, and a comfortable salary. He’s got a wife, two daughters, a nice house in a good neighborhood — this dude’s life seems pretty charmed.</p>
<p>But Adam’s not happy. Long hours and no work-life balance — Adam calls it more of a “work-<em>work</em> balance” — have left him feeling stuck, and contemplating quitting it all in search of something more meaningful.</p>
<p>In this conversation, Nate Green and Jason Lengstorf talk with Adam about what balance, perception, and success really mean. Then the three of them come up with an experiment that just might change Adam’s life — <em>without</em> requiring him to ruin his career.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The audio on this call is a little janky, with some background noise and lag, since everyone was calling in from different corners of the world. If you can forgive the quality of the recording, we hope the quality of the content makes up for it.</p>

<h2 id="Show-Notes"><a href="#Show-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Show Notes:"></a>Show Notes:</h2><p>6:30 — “You give up a lot of things when you work 65–70 hours a week.” – Adam</p>
<p>7:12 — “Daddy, are you going to sleep at the office again tonight?” – Adam’s daughter</p>
<p>9:46 — “Would that be perceived as a step backward?” – Nate</p>
<p>11:11 — “You don’t get a bunch of people to slave away at this if they think they have better things to do.” – Adam</p>
<p>11:58 — “It feels really dirty, like you’re doing something awful to the company…” – Jason</p>
<p>12:30 — “It’s self-defeating in a lot of ways. … People who are really bright and capable crash out of the industry really quickly because they’re chewed up by that cutthroat culture.” – Adam</p>
<p>14:28 — “It’s like the celebration of who can be the biggest masochist.” – Jason</p>
<p>14:45 — “You have all these external trappings of success. … Does that stuff mean anything to you?” – Nate</p>
<p>16:00 — “At this private high school I was a hillbilly. It ingrained in me this aspiration for more.” – Adam</p>
<p>17:48 — “You realize you’re the same person with a nice watch.” – Adam</p>
<p>18:56 — “It keeps moving the idea of happiness outside of you.” – Jason</p>
<p>23:28 — “I fooled myself into thinking I was being a really good provider, but … I wasn’t doing nearly enough on the family side.” – Adam</p>
<p>24:59 — “It wasn’t really about the money I was making. It was about getting that hit of validation.” – Adam</p>
<p>32:53 — “Maybe it’s almost envy because you note that they’re comfortable enough that they don’t have to respond right away, and you feel compelled to.” – Adam</p>
<p>34:57 — “I had fully expected that my career was going to suffer as a result. … What I found was that my entire team was releived … and my clients didn’t even notice.” – Jason</p>
<p>38:09 — “Do you want the promotion?” – Nate</p>
<p>38:15 — “…not really.” – Adam</p>
<p>42:36 — “What’s the worst that could happen? The fire me and I don’t get the promotion? I’ve already said that I don’t really want it.” – Adam</p>
<p>45:00 — “You just see, ‘Is this a thing worth doing?’” – Nate</p>
<p>50:43 — “What if it was like, ‘I have this thing I cannot miss: I’m going to go eat dinner with my family at 7pm’?” – Nate</p>
<p>52:04 — “What I was depressed about was all the things that were being left behind in pursuit of the work.” – Jason</p>
<p>54:36 — “This is a stupid fucking analogy.” – Nate</p>
<p>55:46 — “Now, at least once a week, work is subordinated to family. It changes the dynamic.” – Jason</p>
<p>1:02:01 — “A lot of what I’ve accomplished in my life is because I was consistently seeking the approval of others.” – Adam</p>
<p>1:03:02 — “I’ve sort of turned hard work and discipline — which are positives — into negatives.” – Adam</p>
<p>1:03:18 — Adam mentions <a href="https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Cult of Work You Never Meant to Join</em></a>.</p>
<p>1:03:42 — “I’m starting to look for that validation and that happiness and that contentment internally rather than externally.” – Adam</p>
<p>1:06:48 — “It’s a really small thing, but it’s symbolic of the change in my attitude.” – Adam</p>
<p>1:07:18 — “The best habits are kept by doing small things consistently.” – Nate</p>
